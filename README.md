### Hi there, I'm Eyad (CanadianGamer or EasyCanadianGamer)ðŸ‘‹

I am an computer science student who plays way too much Minecraft. I also have two yotube channels, one for minecraft/gaming ( CanandianGamer) and a seperate one for other topics that I enjoy doing outside of gaming (like programming, making websites, and tech reviews).  

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ProjexNexa a minimal dashboard summazring projects.
-  ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning AI & Machine Learning and Cybersecurity. And how they function together. 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love Minecraft and I hate java, but I love modding minecraft, so I have a hate and love releationship with Java.
